# Millenaire JEI Plugin

This mod adds JEI support for many aspects of the [Millenaire mod](https://millenaire.org/)

## Features

 - Items that can be bought and sold from villagers
    - Includes prices as well as which village types and buildings
 - How villagers obtain various items for themselves
    - Useful if the villagers don't have an item stocked to sell, or to upgrade their buildings
    - Includes mining/gathering, crafting, and animal slaughtering
 - Some Millenaire-specific crafting techniques
    - Mud bricks from brick mould and drying in the sun
    - Paint buckets used on painted bricks
 - Hide some of Millenaire's "technical" blocks to reduce JEI bloat
    - Items for behind-the-scenes village operation that the player doesn't interact with
    - Examples include animal spawn blocks and source blocks that villagers mine from
 - Each of the above can be toggled in this mod's config file

All trading and villager crafting recipes are loaded from Millenaire's config files, so custom cultures/mods should be supported
